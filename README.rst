**NOTE** as GM continues to not make a real API available to end users, and I
 don't really have the time to keep chasing their internal changes, this
 library is largely unmaintained.


For home assistant integration, my suggestion is the https://github.com/michaelwoods/onstar2mqtt project, which
does everything I was doing, but better supported, and works with HA MQTT
discovery.
